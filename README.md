## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on setting up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (v20.x or later)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A Google Developer Account and GitHub Account for OAuth integration.

### Set Up Google and GitHub OAuth Applications
Follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/DIMO-Network/dimo-developer-console?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-google-and-github-oauth-applications) to set up your Google and Github OAuth applications. The credentials that you created for those applications should be reused here.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DIMO-Network/dimo-developer-console-api.git
cd dimo-developer-console-api
```

2. Set up environment variables:

- Create a .env.local file in the root directory of the project:

```bash
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=admin
PGDATABASE=dimo-dev-console
PGPASSWORD=12345
PGPORT=5432

# TODO - try to remove these if not needed
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>

# Your ZAPIER lead generation path, leave empty for dev environments
ZAPIER_LEAD_WEBHOOK_PATH=
STRIPE_API_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET>
COINMARKET_API=<YOUR_SECRET>
COINMARKET_API_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET>
```

3. Database Setup:

- Start the PostgreSQL instance using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- This command will start a PostgreSQL instance on your local machine as defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

## Project Structure

A brief description of the main folders and files in the project:

- `./src/app/api`: Contains all the application API routes using the new App Router in Next.js.
- `./src/config`: Configuration files
  - `default` is mainly used for the development environment and default values in `staging` and `prod`
  - `preview` is mainly used for changing variable values in the staging environment.
  - `production` is mainly used for changing variable values in the production environment.
- `./src/controllers`: Handles the logic for processing requests and returning responses in the application.
- `./src/services`: Contains the business logic of the application, interacting with the database, APIs, and other services.
- `./src/models`: Sequelize models that define the schema and relationships of the PostgreSQL database.
- `./src/scripts`: Scripts used for initializing PostgreSQL with Docker.
- `./src/types`: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces used throughout the application.
- `./src/utils`: Utility functions and helper methods that are used across different parts of the application.


## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **JavaScript/ES6+**: Modern JavaScript syntax and features.


## Database Setup

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.

2. Set up environment variables:

- Make sure the `PG` related variables in your .env.local file is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL instance that will be created by Docker. Your .env.local file should look something like this:

```bash
PGHOST=<YOUR_PG_HOST>
PGUSER=<YOUR_PG_USER>
PGDATABASE=<YOUR_PG_DATABASE>
PGPASSWORD=<YOUR_PG_PASSWORD>
PGPORT=<YOUR_PG_PORT>
```

- Replace username, password, localhost, 5432, and the database name with your specific PostgreSQL credentials, host, port, and database name as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Start the PostgreSQL instance using Docker:

- Run the following command to start the Docker containers defined in your docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- This command will start a PostgreSQL instance on your local machine, accessible via the credentials and settings specified in the `PG` environment variables.

4. You can connect to the PostgreSQL instance using a database management tool like pgAdmin or via the command line to verify the setup.
